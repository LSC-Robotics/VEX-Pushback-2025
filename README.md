These are the foolproof instructions to get this code onto your robot:

1. Run: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smallrobot.git   (you can do this in terminal or vs code)
2. open that folder in VSCode
3. install PROS extension if you don't have it.
4. connect the USB to the VEX Brain. Make sure it is a data USB - there are some "charge only" usb cables out there.
5. run "make upload" in terminal or use the PROS extension "upload"
6. Once completed, select the smallrobot2 icon from programs on the brain.
7. turn on your VEX controller with a data cable temporarily connected (if not already linked to the wirless)

Warning! As of 01/28/2026 there appears to be a bug when running the program from the controller and we ar eworking on it. ONLY press run from the brain
